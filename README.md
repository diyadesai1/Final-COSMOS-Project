Crossover game of Monopoly and Pacman, using Pygame, to collect dollars, build houses/hotels, etc all while trying not to go to jail.

Have you ever wished to play two of your favorite games simultaneously? GTG 2 Boardwalk is a crossover game between the classic games, 
Monopoly and Pac-Man, using pygame to collect dollars, build houses and hotels, and more, all while trying to not go to jail. Monopoly
has dominated the board game industry; created during the Great Depression, this board game retains its popularity even now. Similarly,
no video game has had a greater impact on pop culture than Pacman. This combination of two impactful games brings surprises and joy for 
players. 

After extensive research and practice labs, we found information about both Monopoly and Pac-Man and learned technical skills for
creating games using pygame. 

The game composes of a basic maze made up of multiple rectangles drawn onto the screen as the map and uses the
collidelist function to stop the monopoly man when colliding with the maze. 

The Monopoly Man uses the keydown, variables, and move_up functions to make its way around the maze and collect dollars which determine
the number of houses, hotels, score, and highscore, which is all written below the game. 

The goal of the police is to move around the maze and collide with the Monopoly Man to send him to jail. The  ending result of our project
is a hybrid of monopoly and pacman. This game is important because it is an antidote for all the violent/graphic video games in todayâ€™s society.
